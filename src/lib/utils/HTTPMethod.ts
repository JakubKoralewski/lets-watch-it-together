 * HTTP request methods.
 *
 * HTTP defines a set of request methods to indicate the desired action to be
 * performed for a given resource. Although they can also be nouns, these
 * request methods are sometimes referred as HTTP verbs. Each of them implements
 * a different semantic, but some common features are shared by a group of them:
 * e.g. a request method can be safe, idempotent, or cacheable.
